    "# Using the Staff Training Scheduler Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial is a step-by-step guide to using the staff query and training scheduler tool in the native python. When we get to the actual scheduling tool, I'll briefly explain the mathematical assumptions underlying the tool, though for those of you who are only interested in using the app I've built, feel free to skip said section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin. The first thing that we'll need is to generate a training matrix for all the staff in the company. Since this program was written originally for BrainStorm STEM Edu LLC (BrainStorm), I'll be referring to the documents they provided for the completion of this project. BrainStorm in particular had two different concurrent programs that needed to be trained for, so two different sets of documents are included here. I've included in this tutorial how to switch between documents."

    "Let's say we have three staff members--'A', 'B', and 'C'--and our organization offers after school courses in the following three areas--'Python', 'Lego', and 'Volcanoes'. The initial training matrices for this should look like the following:\n",
    "    \n",

    "    C    0           0           0\n",
    "\n",

INPUT DOCUMENTS FORMAT

The following are examples of the columns required for the three data sheets required to run this program. The initial project required me to take in three documents to mine data fromâ€”
	(a) a csv that contained self-reported proficiencies in courses taught by 	BrainStorm Edu LLC,

	(b) a csv containing what courses were on the horizon for the summer, with names of Instructors and assistants per course, and

	(c) a sheet containing what proficiencies were required to teach the upcoming courses.

Two outputs were required: (a) a list of the courses that staff needed to be trained on, specific to what they would need to teach over the summer, and (b) a training schedule that would most efficiently use the number of rooms available to BrainStorm Edu LLC for training. The name of each sheet as it is coded for in the app are in square brackets adjacent to verbose descriptions of what the sheet contained below.
